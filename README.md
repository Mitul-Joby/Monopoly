This is where the actual gameplay starts. All players are assigned a colour and starting positions are set at START. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="512" alt="MainGame" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73733877/129778872-5c433627-2df6-4aeb-8f6d-57ee2eb7e97a.jpg">
</p>

Each turn, each player who isn't in jail and bankrupt/given up is given options to roll, buy houses and hotels, sell properties they own or to give up.

#### PLAYER ROLLS
Player rolls two dice each of 1-6 thus with a total possibility of 2-12. 
If the player gets doubles (the same number on both dice) the player gets to play again. 
If the player gets too many doubles, they are sent to jail for overspeeding.

## Running the Program:
 To run the program, clone the repo and make the [Makefile](./Makefile).
 
 > `mingw32-make all` if using mingw32
 
 Run on command prompt.
 
 > `Monopoly.exe`
 
 NOTES:
 Before running the program, make sure command prompt is maximised and in full screen for best experience. 
 Failure to do so can result undesirable outputs.
 Some screen resolutions are not supported.

## Makefile Targets:

### all
 Compiles all necessary files and creates .o files and places them in a folder called obj and makes Monopoly.exe

### Monopoly
 Directly compiles necessary files and creates Monopoly.exe

### OFiles 
 Compiles all necessary files and creates .o files and places them in a folder called obj.
 
### clean
 Removes all .o and .exe files created during make `all`.


## Future Plans
 - Might add terminal resizing.
